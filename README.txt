QUESTION: Do you think the means and/or variances of helpfulness values may differ significantly between different products or customers?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, because some products or customers may have a huge variety of helpfulness votes on their reviews, while other product or
customer reviews might consistently align to a certain number of helpfulness votes. Each customer and product can greatly vary
in the number of reviews they have as well, which can really affect the mean and variance values.
